# https://github.com/ianmorgan/graph-store/blob/master/src/schema/starwars_ex.graphqls
#
# This is an extension of the base starwars schema that includes additional data to demonstrate and test
# all the features in the graphstore app. This includes:
#   - support for external data sources (Starship)
#   - nested types resolved by id (starships in Droid) - this is 'aggregation' in UML speak
#   - nested types fully encapsulated (species in Alien) - this is 'composition' in UML speak
#
